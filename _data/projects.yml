- name: Android Obstacle Detection
  descr: "(1) Implement Image Convolutional filters in C++ optimized to run on Android mobile processors. (2) Capture features using (1) [Using C++ OpenCV massive image processing on a Linux box] and uses them to design & train a Deep Learning model to detect a pre-determined image-class [using Keras+Tensorflow], export the model to be deployed on Mobile Devices. (3) Use the model produced on (2) and deploy it [using NDK + optimized C++ code] to reach real-time predictions running locally on the mobile device. (4) Develop an Android Application to capture images from the camera and present alerts based on predictions."
